`Pixi` allows you to extend its functionality with various extensions.

By default, `Pixi` will try to find the available extension on your `PATH` and execute it by passing any additional arguments to it.

!! note
    From technical standpoint, `any` command that is not declared in the `Pixi` CLI is considered an extension.
